This is a custom version of Single Transferable Vote which uses a custom threshold and redistrbution method.

Candidates are not passed, but rather votes has an array, going from High to Low prefrence votes. Each Prefrence species the "index" of the candidates. And the program returns a list of Candidate Indexes. This lets us take advantage of the nature of how arrays work instead of having to work with Dynamically Allocated Strings.

## THIS CODE IS INCOMPLETE AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.
